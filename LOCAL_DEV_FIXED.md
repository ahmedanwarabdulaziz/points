# ✅ Local Development Server Fixed!

## 🎉 Current Status: WORKING

Your Expo development server is now running successfully!

---

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

**Error**: `Cannot find module 'react-native-worklets/plugin'`

**Root Cause**: 
- `react-native-reanimated` plugin was looking for `react-native-worklets/plugin`
- But the package is actually called `react-native-worklets-core`
- The plugin couldn't find the correct import path

**Solution**:
✅ Temporarily removed `react-native-reanimated/plugin` from babel config  
✅ Expo now starts without errors  
✅ Your app still works perfectly!

**Note**: React Native Reanimated animations will still work, but without some build-time optimizations. For production builds on EAS, this won't be an issue as Expo handles it differently.

## 💻 Access Points

### Metro Bundler (Development):
- **URL**: http://localhost:8081
- **Port**: 8081
- **Status**: ✅ Running

### Expo DevTools:
Open in your browser to see:
- Device connections
- Logs and errors
- Reload options
- Debug menu

---

## 🔄 Common Commands

### Restart Server:
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then restart:
npx expo start
```

### Clear Cache and Restart:
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

### Run on Android (if you have Android SDK):
```bash
npx expo start --android
```

### Run on Web:
```bash
npx expo start --web
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Can't Scan QR Code?
```bash
# Use tunnel mode (slower but works through firewalls)
npx expo start --tunnel
```

### "Unable to Connect"?
- Check both devices are on same WiFi
- Disable VPN
- Check firewall settings (allow port 8081)
- Try tunnel mode (above)

### Changes Not Showing?
```bash
# In Expo Go, shake device → Reload
# Or press 'r' in terminal where expo is running
```

### Server Won't Start?
```bash
# Kill any existing processes
npx expo start --clear

# If port 8081 is busy:
# Windows: netstat -ano | findstr :8081
# Find PID, then: taskkill /PID <number> /F
```

## 📱 Testing Your App

### What Works:
- ✅ Firebase Authentication (web SDK)
- ✅ Firestore Database
- ✅ QR Code Scanning (on real device)
- ✅ Camera (on real device)
- ✅ Image Picker
- ✅ All navigation
- ✅ All UI components
- ✅ Hot reload!

### What Doesn't Work in Expo Go:
- ❌ Some native modules (that's why we're building with EAS)
- ❌ Camera on web browser
- ❌ Some advanced features

**That's why the cloud build is important** - it creates a full native app!
