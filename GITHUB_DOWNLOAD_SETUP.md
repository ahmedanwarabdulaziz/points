# 📱 Setup GitHub APK Downloads - No Queue Waiting!

This guide shows you how to build and distribute your Android APK using GitHub Releases instead of waiting in Expo's build queue.

## 🎯 What You'll Get

- ✅ **No build queue** - Build completes in 15-20 minutes
- ✅ **Free forever** - No costs at all
- ✅ **Professional** - GitHub Releases is trusted
- ✅ **Easy sharing** - Direct download links
- ✅ **Version control** - Track all releases

---

## 📋 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Push Code to GitHub

```powershell
.\push-to-github.ps1
```

This will:
- Add all your code
- Commit changes
- Push to GitHub repository

**Your code will be at**: https://github.com/ahmedanwarabdulaziz/points

---

### Step 2: Build APK

```powershell
.\build-local-apk.ps1
```

This will:
- Start building your APK on Expo servers
- Takes 15-20 minutes (one-time wait)
- Sends you download link when done

**You can do this once, then use GitHub Releases for distribution!**

---

### Step 3: Create GitHub Release

```powershell
.\create-github-release.ps1
```

This will:
- Create a new release on GitHub
- Upload your APK file
- Generate a download link
- Anyone can download from this link!

**Download link format**:
```
https://github.com/ahmedanwarabdulaziz/points/releases/download/v1.0.0/points-redeem-v1.0.0.apk
```

---

## 📱 How Users Download Your App

### Option 1: Direct Link (Easiest)

Share this link with anyone:
```
https://github.com/ahmedanwarabdulaziz/points/releases/latest
```

They will:
1. Click the link
2. See the latest release
3. Click the APK file to download
4. Install on their Android phone

### Option 2: QR Code

Create a QR code for the release page:
```
https://github.com/ahmedanwarabdulaziz/points/releases/latest
```

Users scan → Download → Install

### Option 3: Custom Download Page

Use the download page in `download-page/` folder:
1. Update the APK URL in `index.html`
2. Deploy to Vercel or GitHub Pages
3. Share your custom URL

---

## 🔄 Updating Your App

### For Code Changes (JavaScript/UI):

Use Expo Updates (instant, no rebuild):

```powershell
.\push-update.bat
```

Users get updates automatically next time they open the app!

### For Major Updates (Native code, new features):

1. Make your changes
2. Run `.\build-local-apk.ps1` (build new APK)
3. Run `.\create-github-release.ps1` (create new release)
4. Share the new version link

---

## 🛠️ First-Time Setup

### Install Required Tools

**1. GitHub CLI (for creating releases)**

Download and install from: https://cli.github.com/

Or using winget:
```powershell
winget install --id GitHub.cli
```

**2. Login to GitHub CLI**

```powershell
gh auth login
```

Follow the prompts to authenticate.

**3. Login to Expo**

```powershell
npx eas login
```

Use your Expo account credentials.

# Make changes, then:
.\build-local-apk.ps1
.\create-github-release.ps1
```

### On Your Android Phone:

1. Open browser
2. Go to: `https://github.com/ahmedanwarabdulaziz/points/releases/latest`
3. Click the APK file

```

### 3. Release Notes

Always describe what's new:
- New features
- Bug fixes
- Known issues
- Breaking changes

### 4. Multiple APKs

You can attach multiple files to one release:
- ARM64 version
- x86 version
- Universal APK
