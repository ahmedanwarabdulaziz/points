# ✅ All Issues Fixed!

## 🔧 What I Fixed

### Issue 1: Build Failures (Cloud Build)
**Problem**: React Native Firebase packages conflicting with web Firebase SDK  
**Solution**: ✅ Removed all React Native Firebase packages  
**Result**: Build started successfully!

### Issue 2: Package Lock File Out of Sync
**Problem**: package-lock.json didn't match package.json  
**Solution**: ✅ Deleted and regenerated lock file with correct dependencies  
**Result**: Dependencies synchronized!

### Issue 3: Async Storage Version Conflict
**Problem**: Firebase Auth wanted v1.24.0, we had v2.2.0  
**Solution**: ✅ Downgraded to v1.24.0 to match Firebase requirements  
**Result**: No more peer dependency warnings!

### Issue 4: Missing react-native-worklets (Local Development)
**Problem**: react-native-reanimated needs react-native-worklets-core  
**Solution**: ✅ Added react-native-worklets-core package  
**Result**: Local bundling now works!

### Issue 5: Missing Babel Configuration
**Problem**: No babel.config.js to configure reanimated plugin  
**Solution**: ✅ Created babel.config.js with proper configuration  
**Result**: Babel can now process reanimated code!
