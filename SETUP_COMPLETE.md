## 🚀 Next Steps: Build Your App

### Option 1: Use the Automated Script (Easiest)

```powershell
# Run this command:
.\deploy-to-production.ps1

# Then select option 1 (Build new APK - production)
```

### Option 2: Manual Build Command

```bash
# Build production APK
eas build --profile production --platform android

# This will:
# - Upload your code to Expo servers
# - Build the APK (takes 15-20 minutes)
# - Give you a download link when done
```

## 📱 After Build Completes

### You'll Get:

1. **Download Link** like: `https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/abc123.apk`
2. **Build Page**: https://expo.dev/accounts/ahmedanwarabdulaziz/projects/points-redeem-app/builds

### Share with Users:

**Option A: Direct Link**
- Just share the Expo download link
- Users click → Download → Install

**Option B: Beautiful Download Page**
1. Update `download-page/index.html` (line 270) with your APK link
2. Deploy to Vercel:
   ```bash
   cd download-page
   vercel login
   vercel deploy --prod
   ```
3. Share the Vercel URL with users

### Updates Not Working
- Updates only work for JavaScript changes
- Native module changes need full rebuild
- Check you're on the correct channel (production/preview)

### Can't Install APK on Phone
- Enable "Install from unknown sources" in Android settings
- Security → Unknown sources → Enable for your browser
