# 🚀 START HERE - Get Your App on GitHub!

## ✅ Everything is Ready!

I've created all the scripts you need. Just follow these 3 simple steps:

---

## 📱 **Step 1: Push to GitHub** (2 minutes)

**Double-click this file:**
```
PUSH-TO-GITHUB-NOW.bat
```

This will:
- ✅ Add all your code
- ✅ Create a commit
- ✅ Push to: https://github.com/ahmedanwarabdulaziz/points

**Note:** You may need to login to GitHub in your browser when prompted.

---

## 🔨 **Step 2: Build APK** (20 minutes - mostly waiting)

**Double-click this file:**
```
BUILD-AND-RELEASE.bat
```

This will:
- ✅ Start building your Android APK
- ⏳ Wait 15-20 minutes (you'll get email)
- 📧 Email will have APK download link

**Or manually run:**
```powershell
npx eas build --profile production --platform android
```

---

## 🎁 **Step 3: Create GitHub Release** (2 minutes)

After the build email arrives:

1. **Download the APK** from the email link
2. **Double-click:**
   ```
   create-github-release.ps1
   ```
3. **Follow the prompts** (enter version, APK path)
4. **Done!** Your app is now downloadable!

---

## 🌐 **Your Download Link**

After Step 3, share this link with anyone:
```
https://github.com/ahmedanwarabdulaziz/points/releases/latest
```

They click → Download → Install → Done! 🎉

## ⚡ **Quick Alternative: Manual Method**

If the scripts don't work, you can do it manually:

### Push to GitHub:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/ahmedanwarabdulaziz/points.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Build APK:
```bash
npx eas build --profile production --platform android
```

### Create Release:
1. Go to: https://github.com/ahmedanwarabdulaziz/points/releases/new
2. Tag: `v1.0.0`
3. Title: `Points Redeem App v1.0.0`
4. Upload your APK file
5. Click "Publish release"
