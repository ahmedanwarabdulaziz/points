# üîß Build APK Locally - NO EXPO BUILD SERVICE!

This guide shows you how to build your Android APK **on your own computer** without using Expo's build service.

---

## üéØ **Two Methods:**

### **Method 1: GitHub Actions** ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED (Automatic, Free)
### **Method 2: Build on Your Windows PC** (Manual, but you control it)

---

## ‚≠ê **METHOD 1: GitHub Actions (Automatic & Free)**

### How It Works:
1. You push code to GitHub
2. GitHub automatically builds your APK
3. Download the APK from GitHub
4. Upload to Vercel
5. Done!

### Setup (One Time - 5 minutes):

**I've already created the GitHub Actions workflow for you!**

The file is: `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`

**All you need to do:**

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   cd points-redeem-app
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions build"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **GitHub will automatically build your APK!**
   - Go to: https://github.com/ahmedanwarabdulaziz/points/actions
   - Watch the build progress (takes ~10 minutes)
   - Download the APK when done

3. **Add APK to Vercel:**
   - Download APK from GitHub Actions
   - Copy to `vercel-download/public/points-redeem.apk`
   - Deploy to Vercel

**No Expo queue! No Expo service! All on GitHub!** üéâ

## üñ•Ô∏è **METHOD 2: Build Locally on Windows**

### Prerequisites:

1. **Install Android Studio:**
   - Download: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - Install Android SDK
   - Accept license agreements

2. **Install Java JDK 17:**
   - Download: https://adoptium.net/
   - Install and set JAVA_HOME

### Build Steps:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to your project
cd points-redeem-app

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Generate Android native project
npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean

# 4. Build the APK
cd android
.\gradlew assembleRelease

# 5. Find your APK at:
# android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

**That's it!** Your APK is built locally!

### Copy to Vercel:

```bash
# From points-redeem-app directory:
copy android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk vercel-download\public\points-redeem.apk
```

---

## üöÄ **Complete Workflow (GitHub Actions Method)**

### First Time Setup:

```bash
# 1. Push code to GitHub
cd points-redeem-app
git add -A
git commit -m "Setup GitHub Actions build"
git push origin main

# 2. Go to GitHub Actions
# https://github.com/ahmedanwarabdulaziz/points/actions

# 3. Wait for build to complete (~10 min)

# 4. Download APK from Actions artifacts

# 5. Copy to Vercel folder
# Copy the downloaded APK to: vercel-download/public/points-redeem.apk

# 6. Deploy to Vercel
cd vercel-download
# Go to https://vercel.com and deploy!
```

### For Future Builds:

```bash
# Just push to GitHub:
git add -A
git commit -m "Update app"
git push origin main

# GitHub automatically builds new APK!
# Download from Actions, replace in Vercel folder
```

---

## üöÄ **Complete Workflow (Local Build Method)**

### First Time Setup:

```bash
# 1. Install Android Studio and Java JDK 17

# 2. Build APK
cd points-redeem-app
npm install
npx expo prebuild --platform android
cd android
.\gradlew assembleRelease

# 3. Copy to Vercel folder
cd ..
copy android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk vercel-download\public\points-redeem.apk

# 4. Deploy to Vercel
cd vercel-download
# Go to https://vercel.com and deploy!
```

### For Future Builds:

```bash
# Make changes, then:
cd points-redeem-app
npm install
npx expo prebuild --platform android
cd android
.\gradlew assembleRelease
cd ..
copy android\app\build\outputs\apk\release\app-release.apk vercel-download\public\points-redeem.apk

# Redeploy to Vercel (or it auto-deploys if connected to GitHub)
```

## ‚ö° **Comparison:**

| Method | Build Time | Setup | Automatic | Best For |
|--------|-----------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **GitHub Actions** | ~10 min | 5 min | ‚úÖ Yes | Everyone! |
| **Local Build** | ~5 min | 30 min | ‚ùå No | Advanced users |

**Recommendation: Use GitHub Actions!** ‚≠ê

## üéØ **Which Method Should You Use?**

### **Choose GitHub Actions if:**
- ‚úÖ You want automatic builds
- ‚úÖ You don't want to install Android Studio
- ‚úÖ You want builds to happen in the cloud
- ‚úÖ You want it simple and free

### **Choose Local Build if:**
- ‚úÖ You already have Android Studio
- ‚úÖ You want faster builds
- ‚úÖ You want complete control
- ‚úÖ You build frequently

---

## üì¶ **After Building:**

### 1. Copy APK to Vercel:

```bash
# The APK is at one of these locations:

# GitHub Actions:
# Download from: https://github.com/ahmedanwarabdulaziz/points/actions
# Then copy to: vercel-download/public/points-redeem.apk

# Local Build:
# Located at: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
# Copy to: vercel-download/public/points-redeem.apk
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel:

Go to: https://vercel.com
- Import your GitHub repo
- Set root to: `vercel-download`
- Deploy!

### 3. Share Your URL:

```
https://points-redeem.vercel.app
```

## ‚úÖ **Advantages (No Expo Build Service!):**

‚úÖ **No Expo Queue** - Build on GitHub or locally  
‚úÖ **Free Forever** - GitHub Actions is free  
‚úÖ **Fast Builds** - 5-10 minutes  
‚úÖ **Complete Control** - You own the build process  
‚úÖ **No Build Limits** - Build as many times as you want  
‚úÖ **Open Source** - Everything is in your control

## üÜò **Troubleshooting**

### GitHub Actions Build Fails:

1. Check the logs: https://github.com/ahmedanwarabdulaziz/points/actions
2. Common issues:
   - Dependencies mismatch: Run `npm install` locally first
   - Android SDK issues: Usually auto-fixed by GitHub Actions
3. Re-run the workflow

### Local Build Fails:

**"Android SDK not found"**
```bash
# Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable
# Windows: Set in System Environment Variables
# Point to: C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
```

**"Java version mismatch"**
```bash
# Install Java JDK 17
# Download from: https://adoptium.net/
```

**"Gradle build failed"**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild:
cd android
.\gradlew clean
.\gradlew assembleRelease
```

---

## üéä **You're Ready!**

**GitHub Actions Method (Recommended):**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Setup build"
git push origin main

# Then go to: https://github.com/ahmedanwarabdulaziz/points/actions
# Download APK when build completes
# Copy to vercel-download/public/
# Deploy to Vercel!
```

**Local Build Method:**
```bash
npm install
npx expo prebuild --platform android
cd android
.\gradlew assembleRelease
# APK is in: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/
```

---

## üöÄ **Next Steps:**

1. **Choose your build method** (GitHub Actions recommended!)
2. **Build the APK**
3. **Copy to Vercel folder:** `vercel-download/public/points-redeem.apk`
4. **Deploy to Vercel:** https://vercel.com
5. **Share your URL!**

**NO EXPO BUILD SERVICE NEEDED! üéâ**
