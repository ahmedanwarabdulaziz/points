Your Firebase project is connected:
- **Project:** points-project-f0968
- **Auth:** ✅ Ready
- **Firestore:** ✅ Ready
- **Storage:** Using public URLs instead (no cost!)

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Enable Firebase Services (5 minutes)

2. Click "Email/Password" → Enable toggle → Save

**B) Create Firestore:**
1. Click "Firestore Database" → "Create database"
2. Choose "Test mode" → Select location → Enable

✅ **Done!**

### Step 2: Run the App

```bash
cd points-redeem-app
npm start
```

Then press:
- `w` - Web browser (easiest to test)
- `a` - Android emulator
- `i` - iOS simulator (Mac only)

### Step 3: Test Registration

1. App opens → Welcome screen
2. Click "Scan QR to Get Started"
3. Or click "Already have account? Login"
4. Try creating an account
5. Check Firebase Console → You should see your user!

## 🎨 Design System

**Brand Colors:**
- Primary Blue: `#274290` - Professional
- Secondary Orange: `#f27921` - Energy/rewards
- Background Gray: `#e6e7e8` - Soft backgrounds

**Fonts:**
- Headers: Playfair Display (Serif)
- Body: Source Sans Pro (Sans-serif)

## 💾 Image Storage Solution

**Decision: Using Public URLs (No Cloud Storage)**

**Why?**
- ✅ Free - No storage costs
- ✅ Simple - Just paste image URLs
- ✅ Fast - No upload time
- ✅ Professional - Businesses use their own hosted logos

**How it works:**
- Business enters their logo URL: `https://example.com/logo.png`
- We store just the URL string in Firestore
- Image loads from their server when displayed

**Future:** Can migrate to Cloudinary (25GB free) or Supabase Storage later if needed.

See `STORAGE_STRATEGY.md` for full details.

## 👥 User Roles

The app supports 4 user types (role-based routing):

1. **Customer** 
   - Earn/redeem points
   - View rewards
   - Transaction history
   - Referral system

2. **Business Owner**
   - Manage business
   - Create flash offers
   - Create customer tags
   - View analytics

3. **Business Staff**
   - Scan customers
   - Give points
   - Validate redemptions

4. **Super Admin** (You!)
   - Manage all businesses
   - Connect businesses
   - Approve high-value transactions
   - Platform analytics

## 🔍 Testing the App

### Create Different User Types:

**1. Customer Account:**
```
Register through app → Role: customer (default)
```

**2. Super Admin Account:**
```
1. Register normally
2. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore
3. Find your user in 'users' collection
4. Edit document → Change role to: super_admin
5. Reload app → You're now super admin!
```

**3. Business Owner:**
```
Super admin creates business → assigns owner
OR manually set role to: business_owner in Firestore
```

## 📱 Current Features

- [ ] Customer wallet display
- [ ] Business dashboard with stats
- [ ] Staff QR scanning functionality  
- [ ] Points earning system
- [ ] Transaction processing
- [ ] Rewards display & redemption

## ⚙️ Available Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Run on specific platform
npm run android
npm run ios
npm run web

# Clear cache (if issues)
npm start -- --reset-cache

# Install new packages
npm install package-name

# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Firebase: Error (auth/configuration-not-found)"
**Fix:** Enable Email/Password in Firebase Console → Authentication

### "Metro bundler error"
**Fix:** `npm start -- --reset-cache`

### App won't load
**Fix:** 
1. Check Firebase setup (see FIREBASE_SETUP.md)
2. Make sure `npm start` is running
3. Try web first (`w` key)

### TypeScript errors
**Fix:** Most are just warnings during development, app will still run
