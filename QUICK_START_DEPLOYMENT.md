## 🎯 Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setup EAS (5 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd "D:\Res\Points Redeem\points-redeem-app"

# Run the setup script
.\quick-android-setup.ps1
```

When prompted:
- Create Expo account or login
- Answer "Yes" to all setup questions

You'll get a **Project ID** - copy it!

### Step 2: Update Configuration (2 minutes)

Open `app.config.js` and replace `'your-project-id-here'` with your actual project ID:

```javascript
// Replace in TWO places:
extra: {
  eas: {
    projectId: 'abc123-def456-ghi789',  // ← Your project ID here
  },
},
updates: {
  url: 'https://u.expo.dev/abc123-def456-ghi789',  // ← And here
```

### Step 3: Build Your Android App (20 minutes)

```bash
# Start the build
eas build --profile production --platform android
```

This happens on Expo's servers (you can close your computer!).

**While building:**
- Check status at https://expo.dev
- You'll get an email when done
- ☕ Take a coffee break!

### Step 4: Get Your Download Link (1 minute)

When build completes, you'll see:

```
✔ Build successful
Download: https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/abc123xyz.apk
```

**Copy this link!** This is what users will download.

### Step 5: Share with Users (2 minutes)

**Option A: Share Direct Link (Simplest)**

Just send users the Expo download link:
```
https://expo.dev/artifacts/eas/abc123xyz.apk
```

**Option B: Create Beautiful Download Page (Recommended)**

```bash
# Deploy download page to Vercel
cd download-page

# First, update index.html with your APK link (line ~200)
# Then deploy:
npm install -g vercel
vercel login
vercel deploy --prod
```

You'll get a nice URL like: `https://points-redeem.vercel.app`

Share this with users!

## 🔄 How to Update Your App

### For Code Changes (Daily Updates):

```bash
# Make your code changes
# ... edit files ...

# Push update (takes 2 minutes!)
eas update --branch production --message "Fixed bug in login"
```

**Users get update automatically next time they open the app!**

### For Major Changes (Monthly/Quarterly):

If you add new native libraries or change app icon:

```bash
# Rebuild APK
eas build --profile production --platform android

# Get new download link and update your download page
```

---

## 🎨 Customize Your Download Page

Edit `download-page/index.html`:

1. **Change APK link** (line ~200):
   ```javascript
   const APK_URL = 'YOUR_EXPO_LINK_HERE';
   ```

2. **Update version number** (line ~49):
   ```html
   <p class="version">Version 1.0.0 • Latest Release</p>
   ```

3. **Customize features** (lines ~65-71):
   ```html
   <div class="feature-item">Your feature here</div>
   ```

4. **Change support email** (line ~142):
   ```html
   <strong>your-email@example.com</strong>
   ```

Then redeploy:
```bash
vercel deploy --prod
```

### "Updates not working"
- Only JS code updates work
- Native changes need full rebuild
- Check you're on correct channel

### "Can't install APK on phone"
