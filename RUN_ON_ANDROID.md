# üöÄ QUICK START - Run on Android

## üî¥ The Problem

Your app shows **"No App"** or **"Couldn't start project"** because you're using **Firebase native modules** which don't work with the regular Expo Go app.

## ‚úÖ The Solution (Choose ONE)

---

### Option A: Use EAS Build (RECOMMENDED - 30 minutes) ‚≠ê

**Best for**: Full app testing with all features working

#### Quick Steps:

1. **Run the setup script**:
   ```powershell
   .\quick-android-setup.ps1
   ```
   
2. **Follow the prompts** (it will ask you to):
   - Login to Expo (create free account at expo.dev)
   - Start the build
   
3. **Wait 15-20 minutes** for the build to complete

4. **Download and install the APK** on your Android phone

5. **Run the dev server**:
   ```bash
   npm start --dev-client
   ```

6. **Open the app** on your phone - it will auto-connect!

**‚úÖ PROS**: No Android SDK needed, all features work, easy setup

---

### Option B: Test UI Only with Expo Go (5 minutes) ‚ö°

**Best for**: Quick UI/layout testing (Firebase won't work)

#### Quick Steps:

1. **Install Expo Go** on your Android phone from Play Store

2. **Make sure phone and computer are on the same WiFi**

3. **Start Expo**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Scan the QR code** with Expo Go app

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Firebase, Camera, and some features won't work. Use only for UI testing.

---

### Option C: Full Local Build (2-3 hours) üõ†Ô∏è

**Best for**: Professional development setup

#### Quick Steps:

See `ANDROID_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for complete instructions.

1. Install Android Studio
2. Set up Android SDK
3. Create emulator
4. Run: `npx expo run:android`

**‚úÖ PROS**: Full control, offline development
**‚ùå CONS**: Long setup time, requires Android SDK (~5GB)

## üéØ My Recommendation

**Start with Option A (EAS Build)**

It's the fastest way to get your full app running on Android without installing Android Studio.

### Ready to start?

Run this command:
```powershell
.\quick-android-setup.ps1
```

The script will guide you through everything!
