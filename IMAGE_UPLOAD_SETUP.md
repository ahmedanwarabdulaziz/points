## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Service Used: ImgBB**

- **API Endpoint:** `https://api.imgbb.com/1/upload`
- **Format:** Base64 upload
- **Storage:** Unlimited (free tier)
- **CDN:** Fast, reliable image delivery
- **URLs:** Direct image links (e.g., `https://i.ibb.co/xxx/image.png`)

### **Configuration:**

API Key is configured in `src/services/imageUpload.ts`:
```typescript
const IMGBB_API_KEY = '9d2395e8d8d24e31ae31267920db33c0';
```

### **Upload Flow:**

1. User selects image → `expo-image-picker` provides local URI
2. Image converts to base64 → `FileReader.readAsDataURL()`
3. Upload to ImgBB → `POST https://api.imgbb.com/1/upload`
4. Receive permanent URL → `result.data.url`
5. Save URL to Firestore → Business document updated
6. Display image → React Native `<Image>` component

## 📱 Supported Platforms

## 🧪 Testing

1. Go to **Businesses** screen
2. Click **Edit** on any business
3. Click **"📷 Change Logo"**
4. Select a new image
5. Click **"Update Business"**
6. Watch console for upload logs:
   ```
   📤 Starting image upload to ImgBB...
   ✅✅✅ IMAGE UPLOADED SUCCESSFULLY TO IMGBB! ✅✅✅
   ✅ Image URL: https://i.ibb.co/xxxxx/image.png
   ```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Image not uploading?**
- Check console for error messages
- Verify API key is correct in `imageUpload.ts`
- Check internet connection

### **Image not displaying?**
- Check console for 404 errors
- Verify URL is saved correctly in Firestore
- Clear browser cache and refresh

### **Upload is slow?**
- Large images take longer (ImgBB processes them)
- Compress images before uploading (recommended: < 2MB)
- Use quality setting in ImagePicker: `quality: 0.8`

**Main Files:**
- `src/services/imageUpload.ts` - Upload service (ImgBB integration)
- `src/screens/admin/AddBusinessScreen.tsx` - Add business with logo
- `src/screens/admin/EditBusinessScreen.tsx` - Edit business logo
- `src/screens/admin/BusinessesScreen.tsx` - Display business logos

**Key Functions:**

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

1. **Camera Support** - Let users take photos instead of selecting
2. **Image Compression** - Reduce file size before upload
3. **Cropping Tool** - Let users crop/rotate images
4. **Multiple Images** - Support image galleries
5. **Progress Bar** - Show upload progress

---

## ℹ️ Notes

- **Old Images:** ImgBB doesn't support API deletion. Old images remain on ImgBB but aren't used in the app.
- **Limits:** ImgBB free tier has no storage or bandwidth limits
- **Security:** API key is client-side (acceptable for ImgBB's free tier)
- **Migration:** If needed, images can be migrated to another service later

---

## 🎉 Summary

**Image uploads are fully working!** No additional setup needed. Just use the app normally and images will upload automatically to ImgBB.

For questions or issues, check the console logs - they provide detailed information about each upload.
